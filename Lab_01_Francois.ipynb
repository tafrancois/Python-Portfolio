Agents take actions in an environment and recieve a numerical reward for each action taken. Actions that help lead the agent toward the goal should result in high rewards and actions that do not lead the agent toward the goal should result in low (and perhaps negative) rewards.\n",

When scoring the actions taken during an episode, we are often interested in not only the reward earned as a result of that action, but the rewards earned afterward in the the episode. The total reward earned from one point onward in an episode is known as the **cumulative reward**. It is often desireable to put more emphasis on rewards earned earlier in the episode. This is accomplished by using a **discount factor** $\\gamma$. The discount factor is a number between 0 and 1. Each reward is multiplied by a power of $\\gamma$, with the power increasing by one for each subsequent reward. The sum of the discounted rewards is called the **return**.\n",
